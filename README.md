## FAQ

**Which brain training platform works best for older adults concerned about cognitive decline?**

BrainHQ stands out for seniors because it's the only platform with peer-reviewed studies proving real-world cognitive improvements rather than just better game scores. The exercises specifically target age-related decline, and 30 years of research backs its effectiveness. CogniFit also serves older adults well by functioning like a thermometer for brain health, measuring 22 cognitive domains to catch problems early before they worsen.

**Do brain training apps actually improve everyday mental performance or just game-playing skills?**

The science shows mixed results depending on the platform. BrainHQ uniquely demonstrates transfer to real-world tasks through numerous peer-reviewed studies. Research on other platforms like NeuroNation shows improvements in working memory and executive functions that benefit daily life. However, simple repetitive games without adaptive difficulty and immediate feedback rarely create meaningful cognitive changes. The most effective platforms personalize challenge levels and target multiple cognitive domains rather than drilling the same task repeatedly.

**How much time do I need to commit to see actual cognitive improvements?**

Most platforms recommend 20-30 minutes of training 3-5 times weekly for noticeable results. CogniFit suggests 20-minute sessions three times per week. Peak training takes just 10 minutes daily. Cogmed requires more intensive commitment with 30-45 minute sessions five days weekly over five weeks, but delivers more dramatic working memory improvements. Consistency matters more than duration—regular practice creates stronger neuronal pathways than occasional marathon sessions.
